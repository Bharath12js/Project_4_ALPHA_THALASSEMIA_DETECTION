The data for this research was obtained from Kaggle, encompassing two distinct datasets with 616 and 243 samples, respectively. 
To ensure a comprehensive analysis, both datasets were combined, resulting in a unified dataset for examination. 

The machine learning classifiers chosen for the comparative study included:
Random Forest 
Logistic Regression
KNN
SVM with Linear kernel, SVM with Polynomial Kernel, SVM with RBF Kernel, SVM with Sigmoid Kernel
Decision Tree
Naive Bayes
Gradient Boost
Ada Boost
XG Boost and Cat Boost. 

Fine-Tuning Techniques used were : RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV

XAI- LIME and SHAP.
